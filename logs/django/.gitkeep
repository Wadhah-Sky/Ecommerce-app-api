# git can't push empty directories. It can only track files.
# If you try to push a folder with nothing in it, although it will exist on your local machine,
# nothing will go into your branch.
# So if someone tries to clone your code, they won't have the same folder structure as you do on your local machine.
# .gitkeep is a common thing you will see in codebases, where an empty folder needs to be tracked via Git.
