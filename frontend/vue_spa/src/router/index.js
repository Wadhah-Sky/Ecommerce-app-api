/**
 * URLs can be classified into two classes: static and dynamic.
 *
 * 1- Static URLs: do not accept string parameters and are not dynamically generated.
 *                 This means that the only way to modify the content of such a web page
 *                 is by changing the HTML code.
 *
 *                 Examples:
 *
 *                 https://www.mydomain.com/articles/my-first-article
 *                 https://www.mydomain.com/en/articles/1/my-first-article
 *
 *
 * 2- Dynamic URLs: contain a query string, which is a part of the URL that assigns values
 *                  to specified parameters. These are passed directly to the server and
 *                  used to dynamically retrieve content from a database.
 *                  Content that will be displayed on the page accordingly, which will change
 *                  based on the result of the query, without the need to touch the HTML code.
 *                  In this case, such a web page acts just like a template for the content.
 *
 *                  Examples:
 *
 *                  https://www.mydomain.com/article.php?id=1
 *                  https://www.mydomain.com/articles/page.php?article_id=1&lang=en

/**
 * Important: We need to add another <router-view> inside the view component who have children

 */

/**
 * Info: When a user is redirected as a result of an action that occurs on a route, it is called
 *       "programmatic navigation".
 *       In Vue.js, we use router.push() method for programmatic navigation. This method pushes
 *       the new entry of the page into the history stack when the user is redirected. So that
 *       users can easily go back to the previous page by clicking the back button.
 *       This method takes three input parameters:
 *
 *       router.push(location, onComplete?, onAbort?)
 *
 *       The first one is the location that needs to be redirected, and this parameter is mandatory.
 *       The second and third parameters are optional. We can define what to be done at the end of
 *       successful navigation or in a navigation failure using them. But we don't use these two optional
 *       parameters after the Vue Router 3.1 update since router.push() method is now returning a promise
 *       after completing the navigation.
 *
 *       Examples: If we consider the location input parameter, there are multiple ways to pass it.
 *                 We can provide string paths, objects, or even named routes as the location:
 *
 *       // as a simple string
 *       router.push('messages')
 *
 *       // as an object with path
 *       router.push({ path: 'messages' })
 *
 *       // as an object with a name and params => /messages/1
 *       router.push({ name: 'messages', params: { userId: '1' } })
 *
 *       // with query string => /messages?plan=archived
 *       router.push({ path: 'messages', query: { status: 'archived' } })
 *
 * Note: "path" and "params" canâ€™t be used at the same time. "params" will be ignored if
 *        the path is used, Therefore you need to use name instead of the path if you are
 *        passing any parameters:
 *
 *        router.push({ name: 'messages', params: { userId } }) // ->  /messages/123
 *        router.push({ path: '/messages', params: { userId } }) // ->  /messages  (This doesn't match the correct route)
 *
 * Note: Dynamic Route Matching, In web applications, it's common to see parameters passed through routes.
 *       So we need a mechanism to dynamically match those routes, and Vue-Router facilitates this feature
 *       with Dynamic segments in a route start with a colon:
 *       And when a route matches, we can access these dynamic segments through $route.params.<name_of_param>
 *       or $route.query.<name_of_query>
 *
 *       const routes = [
 *          {
 *            path: "/messages/chat/:userId",
 *            name: "Message",
 *            component: () => import("../views/Message.vue")
 *       }];
 *
 *       The same "Message" component will be loaded for each use. This is more efficient than destroying and
 *       creating a new one. But, this will prevent lifecycle hooks of that component from running even if the
 *       route is changed. So, you need to watch the $route object or use the "beforeRouteUpdate()" navigation
 *       guard to capture the changes.
 *
 * Important: query string value CAN'T be pass to the route component view as props, the only way to get their
 *            values is by using 'useRoute' method inside that component to returns current route location
 *            details like path, query or params, But, params CAN be pass as props automatically to the component
 *            view but make sure that the params names are the same when defined:
 *            1- in route{path} of your routes array.
 *            2- inside the related component view as props using defineProps().
 *
 *            And so that you don't need to access the params the way you do with query string in the component
 *            in order to get the values you need.
 *            When props is set to true, the route.params will be set as the component props.
 *
 * Info: params and query string are the same when trying to set them in the route{path}.

   The 'history' option when creating the router instance allows us to choose among different history modes.

   1- The hash history mode is created with createWebHashHistory()
      It uses a hash character (#) before the actual URL that is internally passed. Because this section of the
      URL is never sent to the server, it doesn't require any special treatment on the server level. It does however
      have a bad impact in SEO. If that's a concern for you, use the HTML5 history mode.

   2- The HTML5 mode is created with createWebHistory() and is the recommended mode.
      When using createWebHistory(), the URL will look "normal," e.g. https://example.com/user/id. Beautiful!
      Here comes a problem, though: Since our app is a single page client side app, without a proper server configuration,
      the users will get a 404 error if they access https://example.com/user/id directly in their browser. Now that's ugly.
      Not to worry: To fix the issue, all you need to do is add a simple catch-all fallback route to your server. If the
      URL doesn't match any static assets, it should serve the same index.html page that your app lives in. Beautiful,
